# Stroop-task

# Background information:
Stroop Task
This is a simple Stroop task programmed using PsychoPy by Shuo Sun and Chiara Van Reyn. It is a variation of the famous Stroop task developed by John Ridley Stroop and published in 1935. This Stroop task involves two parts or phases. Both phases will make use of word names “Red”, “Blue”, “Yellow”, “Purple” and “Green”. Each word can be presented in one of the colours, with the exception that the word name and the colour it is presented in cannot match.

# The experiment:
For technical reason, we use the keys on the keyboard to represent the corresponding colours: key "1" for “Red”, key "2" for for “Blue”, key "3" for “Yellow”, key "4" for “Purple” and key "5" for “Green”.
Please open both the main.py and function.py at the same time in order to run the experiment.
At the beginning of the experiment, the participant need to enter his or her age, gender and participant number to keep track of the data. In a first phase the participant is required to press the key that represents the actually word of the stimuli, ignoring the colour, as fast as possible. In the second phase the subject is required to press the key represents the colour of the stimuli, ignoring the word, as fast as possible.
The collected of data will be written in the “output” folder. Run “Stroop task data analysis.py” for data analysis.


Happy researching!
