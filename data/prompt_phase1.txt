Welcome to our experiment!

There will be two phases. 
In both of them you will get a display of items. 
On your keyboard you should be able to see five keys with a coloured sticker on it.
In the first phase it's important to press the keys of the corresponding colour's WORD.
Try to do this as fast and as accurate as possible.
Press enter to start.
Good luck!
